//let's add all our tasks for software in this file and check them off as we go


*********Always pull, then make changes, then push

- create interface

    - get basic functionality down first
    - Create a Jpanel visual for Dpad control, Dpad values are already coded for in the function gethpos() in Visual Interface,
    we just need to create a visual to incorportate these values. When Dpad is pressed up the value is 0.25, left 1.0, right 0.5, down 0.75.
- create 3D model for ROV (optional)
sup

- change constant values of -50 and 50 in visual interface to a constants file that can be adjusted later easily, allowing us to convert to voltages easily
